# Java Basics â€“ Syntax, Variables, and Data Types

Welcome to your first hands-on Java lesson! In this section, we'll learn how to **write basic Java programs** and understand the most **foundational concepts**: variables, data types, operators, and control flow.

## Basic Java Program Structure

A simple Java program looks like this:

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```
### Let's break it down:
- **public class Hello:** Every Java program must have a class.

- **public static void main(String[] args):** Entry point of the program (this is where Java starts running).

- **System.out.println():** Used to print to the screen.
  
Don't worry about what public,static,void and all those things, we will be covering it in later chapters.
