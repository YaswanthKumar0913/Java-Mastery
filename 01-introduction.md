# Introduction to Programming Languages
---

Before jumping into Java, let's understand some basic but important concepts:

---
## What is a Programming Language?

- A programming language is a way for humans to tell computers what to do.

- Just like we use English or Hindi to talk to each other, we use programming languages like Java, Python, or C++ to talk to computers.

But hereâ€™s the catch:  
**Computers only understand 0s and 1s (binary)**.
So, we write code in a human-readable language, and then it gets **translated** into machine language.

---
## Why Do We Need Programming Languages?

- Computers need clear instructions to perform any task.
- A programming language helps us give those instructions in such a way that it is understandable by computers.
- It allows us to **create apps, websites, games, software**, and much more.

## Types of Programming Languages

### 1. **Low-Level Languages**
- Closer to machine code (binary).
- Hard to understand for humans.
- Fast and powerful but difficult to write.
- Example: Assembly Language

### 2. **High-Level Languages**
- Easier for humans to understand and write.
- Look more like English.
- Automatically translated to machine code.
- Example: Java, Python, C++, JavaScript

## Compiled vs Interpreted Languages

| Type         | How it works                                | Examples           |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Compiled** | Translates full code before running         | C, C++, Java       |
| **Interpreted** | Translates and runs code line by line        | Python, JavaScript |

- Java is a **mix of both** â€“ it first compiles the code into a special format (bytecode), then interprets it using something called the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.

## Why Learn Java?

Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world.

### Key Reasons:
- Itâ€™s used in **Android apps, web apps, enterprise systems**, and even **banking software**.
- Java is **object-oriented**, which means it follows real-world concepts like classes and objects.
- Itâ€™s **strongly typed** â€“ which helps catch errors early.
- Java has been around for more than 25 years, and it's still going strong!
- You can build almost **anything** with Java: backend servers, desktop apps, Android apps, and more.
